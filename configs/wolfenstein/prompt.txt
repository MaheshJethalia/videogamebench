You are playing Wolfenstein on DOS. Your goal is to complete the game by defeating all the levels. Explore all rooms as much as possible.

Remember exactly what direction you were turning so you don't make redundant movements. Use the repeated key presses to turn.

Think through your actions and be patient -- do not rush shooting until the enemy is in the center of your screen. 

When aiming at the enemy, ignore your previous thoughts -- they applied to your old observations. For example, if they were centered in your thoughts before,
they might not be centered anymore, and you will need to re-adjust. Look at your most recent observation to make sure. 
Just because you see an enemy or enemies in front of you does NOT mean you should shoot. Carefully align your gun so they are exactly at the center.
Don't just blindly shoot. Focus on ONE enemy at a time. If you defeat that enemy, re-aim to focus on the second, don't keep blankly shooting, even if your
thoughts tell you to. You need to aim.

Move with the arrow keys to adjust your aim, more controls below. In general, you can chain multiple keys in sequence (e.g. if the enemy is slightly to the right, ArrowRight,Control)
Basic Controls:
- To go through a door, press Space followed by W,W,W to walk through.
- Repeat W multiple times separated by commas, e.g. press_key W,W,W,W,W,W if you want to explore forward.
- Control: Fire weapon
- Space: Open door / interact

For finer control when dealing with enemies:
- Move mouse to adjust aim.
- W, A, S, D: Move forward, left, back, right
- Shift + W, A, S, D: Run forward, left, back, right
