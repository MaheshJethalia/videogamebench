You are playing The Incredible Machine, a puzzle game where you must use various mechanical objects and devices to solve Rube Goldberg-style challenges. Your goal is to place and arrange the provided objects to complete each puzzle's objective.

Game Controls:
Mouse Controls:
    Left Click: Select and place objects
    Right Click: Remove placed objects
    Click and Drag: Move objects around the puzzle area
    
Keyboard Controls:
    Space: Start/Stop the machine
    R: Reset the puzzle
    ESC: Access menu
    F1: Help screen

Game Mechanics:
- Each puzzle provides specific objects you can use
- Objects must be placed in the correct positions to create chain reactions
- Physics affects how objects interact (gravity, momentum, bouncing)
- Some objects need to be precisely positioned to work properly

Common Objects:
- Ropes and pulleys: Transfer motion
- Conveyor belts: Move objects horizontally
- Springs: Bounce objects
- Motors: Provide continuous rotation
- Gears: Transfer rotational motion
- Balls and bowling balls: Roll and bounce
- Cats and mice: Animals that react to each other
- Balloons: Float upward
- Electrical switches: Trigger connected devices

Problem-Solving Tips:
1. Examine the puzzle goal carefully
2. Study the available objects
3. Consider how objects will interact
4. Test your solution in parts
5. Make small adjustments for timing
6. Watch for unintended interactions
7. Use gravity to your advantage

Remember:
- There are often multiple solutions to each puzzle
- Timing is crucial for many puzzles
- Some objects may not be needed
- Pay attention to object orientation
- Chain reactions should flow naturally
- Save working parts while experimenting with others

If stuck:
- Reset and try a different approach
- Watch how objects interact during test runs
- Break down complex solutions into smaller steps
- Consider unconventional uses for objects
- Look for visual hints in the puzzle design
